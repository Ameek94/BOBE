Examples
========

Practical examples demonstrating JaxBO's capabilities for Bayesian optimization 
and evidence estimation.

Quick Examples
--------------

Start here for hands-on tutorials:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   banana
   cosmology

The :doc:`banana` shows the basics with a simple 2D test function, while 
:doc:`cosmology` demonstrates a realistic application with Cobaya and 
cosmological likelihoods.

Additional Examples
-------------------

More examples are available in the `examples/ directory <https://github.com/dphan-research/jaxbo/tree/main/examples>`_ 
of the repository, including:

- **Himmelblau Function**: Another 2D test problem with multiple local optima
- **Rosenbrock Function**: Classic optimization benchmark
- **CPL Dark Energy Models**: w0-wa parameterization with Planck+DESI
- **MPI Parallelization**: Large-scale cosmology runs using multiple nodes

These can be run directly from the repository after installation.
